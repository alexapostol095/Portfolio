# Portfolio

## Solo Python Projects

### 1. Is the "Clutch Gene" Real in Baseball? Investigating the Differences in the Sabermetric-Based Predictions of High Leverage Performance versus Regular Performance
`Notebook:` [Leverage Analysis](https://nbviewer.org/github/alexapostol095/Projects/blob/main/leverage_notebook.ipynb)

`Description:` In this notebook, I aimed to assess the extent to which variables indicative of OPS+ (On-Base Plus Slugging Plus) are also relevant in predicting tOPS+ (Player-specific OPS+ in High Leverage Situations) and sOPS+. 

### 2. A Visual Analysis of Josiah Gray's 2023 Season
`Notebook:` [Josiah Gray Analysis](https://nbviewer.org/github/alexapostol095/Projects/blob/main/josiah_analysis.ipynb)

`Description:` In this notebook, I aimed to analyze different aspects of Josiah Gray's pitching and potential improvements. I focused on attributes like release points, sequencing, pitch decisions and more. 

## Research Assistant Projects

### Reddit Classification Task

`Repository:` [Reddit Classification Task](https://github.com/alexapostol095/reddit_classification_template/tree/main)

`Description:` This task set up a general template for utilizng LLMs in the interest of Reddit post classification, part of a larger project directed by Dr. Gui Liberali and Dr. David Kusterer. In this instance, I wrote code that utilizes a local llama3 LLM model in order to classify 100 Reddit posts, 50 from the Republican subreddit and 50 from the Democrat subreddit, based on their political leanings. The LLM was tasked to score posts on a scale from 1 to 5, with lower scores corresponding to more republican posts and vice versa. 

### Video Similarity Analysis Task

`Repository:` [Video Similarity Analysis Task](https://github.com/alexapostol095/video_similarity_analysis)

`Description:` This repository contains the code and video files utilized in a project where video similarity analysis was conducted through Siamese Neural Networks and SimCLR embeddings. Computer vision was utilized by extracting frame-level embeddings meant to provide a numerical representation of the subjects/objects within the frames.
